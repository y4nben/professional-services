# Quota Monitoring and Alerting 
> An easy-to-deploy Data Studio Dashboard with alerting capabilities, showing usage and quota limits in an organization or folder.

Google Cloud enforces [quotas](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota) on resource usage for project owners, setting a limit on how much of a particular Google Cloud resource your project can use. Each quota limit represents a specific countable resource, such as the number of API requests made per day to the number of load balancers used concurrently by your application.
Quotas are enforced for a variety of reasons:
- To protect the community of Google Cloud users by preventing unforeseen spikes in usage.
- To help you manage resources. For example, you can set your own limits on service usage while developing and testing your applications.

We are introducing a new custom quota monitoring and alerting solution for Google Cloud customers.
## 1. Summary
Quota Monitoring Solution is a stand-alone application of an easy-to-deploy Data Studio dashboard with alerting capabilities showing all usage and quota limits in an organization or folder.
### 1.1 Four Initial Features
<img src="img/quota_monitoring_key_features.png" align="center" />

*The data refresh rate depends on the configured frequency to run the application.
## 2. Architecture
<img src="img/quota-monitoring-alerting-architecture.png" align="center" />

The architecture is built using Google Cloud managed services - Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Dataflow and BigQuery. 
- The solution is architected to scale using Pub/Sub.
- Cloud Scheduler is used to trigger Cloud Functions. This is also an user interface to configure frequency, parent nodes, alert threshold and email Ids. Parent node could be an organization Id, folder id, list of organization Ids or list of folder Ids.
- Cloud Functions are used to scan quotas across projects for the configured parent node.
- BigQuery is used to store data. 
- Alert threshold will be applicable across all metrics. 
- Alerts can be received by Email, Mobile App, PagerDuty, SMS, Slack, Web Hooks and Pub/Sub. Cloud Monitoring custom log metric has been leveraged to create Alerts.
- Easy to get started and deploy with Data Studio Dashboard. In addition to Data Studio, other visualization tools can be configured. 
- The Data Studio report can be scheduled to be emailed to appropriate team for weekly/daily reporting.

### 3.1 Prerequisites
1. Host Project - A project where the BigQuery instance, Cloud Function and Cloud Scheduler will be deployed. For example Project A. 
2. Target Node - The Organization or folder or project which will be scanned for Quota Metrics. For example Org A and Folder A.
3. Project Owner role on host Project A. IAM Admin role in target Org A and target Folder A.
4. Google Cloud SDK is installed. Detailed instructions to install the SDK [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#mac). See the Getting Started page for an introduction to using gcloud and terraform. 
5. Terraform version >= 0.14.6 installed. Instructions to install terraform here
    - Verify terraform version after installing 

```
terraform -version
```
The output should look like:
```
Terraform v0.14.6
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google v3.57.0
```
*Note - Minimum required version v0.14.6. Lower terraform versions may not work.*
### 3.2 Initial Setup
1. In local workstation create a new directory to run terraform and store credential file
```
mkdir <directory name like quota-monitoring-dashboard>
cd <directory name>
```
2. Set default project in config to host project A
```
gcloud config set project <HOST_PROJECT_ID>
```
The output should look like:
```
Updated property [core/project].
```
3. Ensure that the latest version of all installed components is installed on the local workstation.
```
gcloud components update
```
4. Cloud Scheduler depends on the App Engine application. Create an app engine application in the host project. Replace the region. List of regions where App-Engine is available can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#region).
```
gcloud app create --region=<region>
```
Note: Cloud Scheduler (below) needs to be in the same region as App Engine. Use the same region in terraform as mentioned here. Also, selected region should have a VPC subnet available in the region for the DataFlow deployment.
The output should look like:
```
You are creating an app for project [quota-monitoring-project-3].
WARNING: Creating an App Engine application for a project is irreversible and the region
cannot be changed. More information about regions is at
<https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/locations>.

Creating App Engine application in project [quota-monitoring-project-1] and region [us-east1]....done.                                                                                                                               
Success! The app is now created. Please use `gcloud app deploy` to deploy your first app.

```
### 3.3 Create Service Account
1. In local workstation, setup environment variables. Replace the name of the Service Account in the commands below
```
export DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project 2> /dev/null)
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID="sa-"$DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID 
export DISPLAY_NAME="sa-"$DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID 
```
2. Verify host project Id.
```
echo $DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID
```
3. Create Service Account
```
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID --description="Service Account to scan quota usage" --display-name=$DISPLAY_NAME
```
The output should look like:
```
Created service account [sa-quota-monitoring-project-1].

gsutil cp gs://quota-monitoring-solution-source/v4.2/variables.tf .
gsutil cp gs://quota-monitoring-solution-source/v4.2/terraform.tfvars .
```
2. Verify that you have these 4 files in your local directory:
   - CREDENTIALS_FILE.json
   - terraform/main.tf
   - terraform/variables.tf
   - terraform/terraform.tfvars
### 3.7 Configure Terraform
1. Open terraform.tfvars file in your favourite editor and change values for the variable 
2. Values for variable source_code_bucket_name, source_code_zip and source_code_notification_zip are for source code zip in the storage bucket. These are links to the Cloud Function source code. If you want to upgrade to latest code changes everytime you run 'terraform apply', change to this code source repository. DO NOT CHANGE if you do not want to receive latest code changes while running 'terraform apply' everytime after deployment. 
3. For region, use the same region as used for app engine in earlier steps.
```
vi terraform.tfvars
```
<img src="img/terraform-updated.png" align="center" />

### 3.8 Run Terraform
1. Run terraform commands
   - terraform init
   - terraform plan
   - terraform apply 
     - On Prompt Enter a value: yes

2. This will:
   - Enable required APIs
   - Create all resources and connect them. 
*Note: In case terraform fails, run terraform plan and terraform apply again*
### 3.9 Testing
1. Click ‘Run Now’ on Cloud Job scheduler. 

*Note: The status of the ‘Run Now’ button changes to ‘Running’ for a fraction of seconds. *
<img src="img/run_cloud_scheduler.png" align="center" />

2. To verify that the program ran successfully, check the BigQuery Table. The time to load data in BigQuery might take a few minutes. The execution time depends on the number of projects to scan. A sample BigQuery table will look like this:
<img src="img/test_bigquery_table.png" align="center" />

### 3.10 Data Studio Dashboard setup
1. Go to the [Data studio dashboard template](https://datastudio.google.com/c/u/0/reporting/41cc9be3-6a55-4f32-b904-37f63e4f2c75/page/xxWVB) . If this link is not accessible, reach out to pso-quota-monitoring@google.com to share the dashboard template with your email id. A data studio dashboard will look like this:

6. In the panel, select BigQuery project, dataset id and table name
<img src="img/updated-bq-only-latest-row.png" align="center" />
7. Verify the query by running in BigQuery Editor to make sure query returns right results and there are no syntax errors:
Note: Replace BigQuery project id, dataset id and table name:

```
WITH quota AS
( SELECT
project_id as project_id,
region,
metric,
DATE_TRUNC(addedAt, HOUR) AS HOUR,
MAX(CASE
WHEN mv_type='limit' THEN m_value
ELSE
NULL
END
) AS q_limit,
MAX(CASE
WHEN mv_type='usage' THEN m_value
ELSE
NULL
END
) AS usage
FROM
quota-monitoring-project-34.quota_monitoring_dataset.quota_monitoring_table 
GROUP BY
1,
2,
3,
4 ) 
SELECT
project_id,
region,
metric,
HOUR,
CASE
WHEN q_limit='9223372036854775807' THEN 'unlimited'
ELSE
q_limit
END
AS q_limit,
usage,
ROUND((SAFE_DIVIDE(CAST(t.usage AS BIGNUMERIC),
CAST(t.q_limit AS BIGNUMERIC))*100),2) AS consumption
FROM (
select *,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY project_id,region,metric ORDER BY HOUR desc) AS latest_row 
FROM quota) t
WHERE
latest_row=1
AND usage is not null
AND q_limit is not null
AND usage != '0'
AND q_limit != '0'
````

8. After making sure that query is returning results, replace it in the Data studio, click on the ‘Reconnect’ button in the data source pane.
<img src="img/ds_data_source_config_step_3.png" align="center" />
9. In the next window, click on the ‘Done’ button.

10. Click on ‘Region’ tab and repeat steps from 5 - 9 above with different query:
<img src="img/ds-region-middle.png" align="center" />
And query is as follows: (Replace the project id, dataset id and table name and verify query running in Bigquery editor)

```
SELECT region, metric FROM quota-monitoring-project-49.quota_monitoring_dataset.quota_monitoring_table
WHERE m_value not like "0%"
GROUP BY
    org_id,
    project_id,
    metric,

<img src="img/ds-schedule-email-button.png" align="center" />

### 3.11 Alerting
The alerts about services nearing their quota limits can be configured to be sent via email as well as following external services:
- Slack
- PagerDuty
- SMS
- Custom Webhooks

#### 3.11.1 Slack Configuration
To configure notifications to be sent to a Slack channel, you must have the Monitoring NotificationChannel Editor role on the host project.

##### 3.11.1.1 Create Notification Channel
1. In the Cloud Console, use the project picker to select your Google Cloud project, and then select Monitoring, or click the link here: Go to Monitoring
2. In the Monitoring navigation pane, click  Alerting.
3. Click Edit notification channels.
4. In the Slack section, click Add new. This brings you to the Slack sign-in page:
  - Select your Slack workspace.
  - Click Allow to enable Google Cloud Monitoring access to your Slack workspace. This action takes you back to the Monitoring configuration page for your notification channel.
  - Enter the name of the Slack channel you want to use for notifications.
  - Enter a display name for the notification channel.
5. In your Slack workspace:
  - Invite the Monitoring app to the channel by sending the following message in the channel:
  - /invite @Google Cloud Monitoring
  - Be sure you invite the Monitoring app to the channel you specified when creating the notification channel in Monitoring.

##### 3.11.1.2 Configuring Alerting Policy
1. In the Alerting section, click on Policies.
2. Find the Policy named ‘Resource Reaching Quotas’. This policy was created via Terraform code above.
3. Click Edit.
4. It opens an Edit Alerting Policy page. Leave the current condition metric as is, and click on Next.
5. In the Notification Options, Select the Slack Channel that you created above.
6. Click on Save.

You should now receive alerts in your Slack channel whenever a quota reaches the specified threshold limit.

## 4. Release Note

### 4.1 V4: Quota Monitoring across GCP services

#### New
- The new version provides visibility into Quotas across various GCP services beyond the original GCE (Compute). 
- New Data Studio Dashboard template reporting metrics across GCP services

#### Known Limitations
- The records are grouped by hour. Scheduler need to be configured to start running preferably at the beginning of the hour. 
- Out of the box solution is configured to scan quotas ‘once every day’. The SQL query to build the dashboard uses current date to filter the records. If you change the frequency, make changes to the query to rightly reflect the latest data. 

## 5. What is Next?
1. Graphs (Quota utilization over a period of time)
2. Search project, folder, org, region
3. Threshold configurable for each metric
