# BigQuery Visualiser

This utility provides a web application which can be used to visualise the flow of execution stages within a BigQuery job. This may be useful in identifying problematic stages and provides greater usability for large query plans than the default query plan explanation in the Google Cloud Console.

# Manual

## Overview
BigQuery Visualiser displays a Bigquery Queryplan document. It has two displays:

* Query Tree
* Task Gantt Chart


## Hosting BqVisualiser
BqVisualiser is a single page web app  written in angular. 
Simply copy the compiled output to a webserver and you are good to go.

### Authentication
On opening the page, the app will attempt to authenticate you with your Google account. Once done you will be able to access
your projects.

## Downloading Query Plans
On the 'Select Job' tab there are three options:

* Download from Google Cloud
* Retrieve by job id
* Upload from Computer

Under the card with this title:

1. Select a project from the listbox
2. Click on 'List Jobs'
3. Scroll through the list of jobs and click on the Get button of the job you are interested in

![download from list](src/assets/images/downloadlist.png)


If you select the option `list jobs for all users` then you must have owner permission for the selected project.


Enter a job id in the field. The format of the job id must be:
    <projectname>:<location>.<queryid>

![GetById](src/assets/images/GetById.png)


Assuming you have previously downloaded the query plan using the `bq show -j <jobid>i --format prettyjson` command to a local file,
click on this card the 'Select File to upload' button, navigate to the file and select it. To start uploading click the
Upload button.

## The Tree Tab

The Tree tab shows the query plan as a directed graph.

![Tree](src/assets/images/tree.png)

* DB icons represent BQ tabkes
* all other icons represent actual query stages (input, compute, aggregate, etc.)
* clicking on a node displays the stage and step details on the right

![StageDetails](src/assets/images/StageDetails.png)

![Step Details](src/assets/images/StepDetails.png)

All nodes can be selected. On selection the right hand side tabs called 'Stage Details' and 'Step Details' provide in depth information.

At the bottom a number of tabs show overall plan information:

* Overview (jobId etc)
* Status (running, completed)
* SQL used
* Timings
* Statistics
* Settings

![Overview](src/assets/images/Overview.png)

![Status](src/assets/images/Status.png)

![SQL](src/assets/images/SQL.png)

![Statistics](src/assets/images/Statistics.png)

![Settings](src/assets/images/Settings.png)

## The Timing Tab
The timing Tab displaus a Gantt style view to quickly show how long the indivudal stages take.

![Timing](src/assets/images/Timing.png)

## The Progress Tab
Shows the progress of work over time with details of 

* work completed
* work active
* work outstanding
* slots

![Progress](src/assets/images/progress.png)

This useful to see when the query stalls for any reason, i.e. when stages do not progress 

---
# Known Limits

The application will only display graphs for queries. Load jobs etc do not result in query stages being output.

The Timing Page will not load if the execution times of jobs are less than 1 second. Thisi s a limitation of the graphing 
package.

Clicking the get projects when not yet logged in will result in a login process being started instead. Users need to
click on get projects button again after login was successful.

The Number of records transferred displayed for reads from tables can be incorrect if the stage reads from more than one table.
This is a limitation in the Job Details providewd by BQ.

# Building and Deploying
The applicagtion is a Single Page Application without a backend. It can be built and deployed to any webserver that c capable of serving static pages,
such as:

* Apache
* Tomcat
* IIS

## Client ID

To be able to access the BigQuery REST API you need to have create an OAuth client. Create this in the Google Cloud
Console under APIs & Services > Credentials.
When setting up the Client ID the #Authorized JavaScript origins# 
needs to be set to the URL from where the app is downloaded.

And #Authorized redirect URIs# need to be set to:

*  [download URL] 
*  [download URL]/ 
*  [download URL]/jobs

Once Done, set the value for *clientId* in the file ./envirnments/environment.prod.ts to 
the *ClientId* value in the console's Credential page

##Building
The Angular UI needs to be installed.
The compile with
  *ng build --prod*

THe output will e in the dist package. Deploy its contents to the web server  


# Known Bugs

On clicking the Login button, the login dialog appears. After completing 
the dialog successfully, the login button is still highlighted.
The user needs to click the button again so that hte logout button is highlighted,
before being able to download query plans.

Download from Google Cloud => Get Projects function is very slow.
